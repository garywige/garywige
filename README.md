### Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I love coding in all its forms, but my current focus is web development because that appears to reach the largest audience these days. My dream is to produce, or to help produce, quality cloud-based solutions that will satisfy users from around the globe. 

### Current Interests

- Angular
- Node.js
- PowerShell
- TypeScript
- Docker

### My Background

I first started my coding journey around the year 2000, when I was 16 years old. A school friend let me borrow a book on HTML. I know, that's not a programming language! But that's where it started if I'm honest. I enjoyed the topic and even helped some of my family with their websites, but without any JavaScript knowledge, the sites were pretty boring. I knew I had to learn JavaScript to really get good at web development, but I felt so overwhelmed because I was alhttps://courses.gameinstitute.com/est. First, I found an interview with John Carmack talking about Doom 3 that was about to be released soon and what it took to develop the game engine. I was captivated with topics of per-pixel lighting, graphics shaders, and the overall improvements that Microsoft had been making with DirectX at the time. It wasn't until that moment that I realized how much the topic of coding *really* interested me. Suddenly, I found myself having an intense desire to sit down with John and ask him where I should start learning these topics. 

I devoured that magazine and I had no idea how long the rabbit hole was that I was about to go into. I found another article that talked about something Microsoft was working on at the time called XNA Studio. It was basically a .NET wrapper for DirectX, but my brain saw this as "easy path to game development" for some reason. It wasn't more than a week that I found a book on XNA which I must have read through cover-to-cover in less than a month. I loved it, but I felt it would have been better if I knew more about C#. I then read a book on C#, learning all about OOP. I loved C#, but I finally realized that XNA wasn't around to stay. 

DirectX was tough. I tried starting with books on DirectX and it didn't take long for my lack of C++ knowledge to get in the way. I found an online game programming school named (Game Institute)[https://courses.gameinstitute.com/] and took all of their available C++ courses. I took most of the available DirectX courses and absolutely loved working with it. Win32 programming was fun too but that was already an obsolete way of coding GUI apps now that XAML had been around at that time. I tried applying as a game programmer at a few places, but no one ever called :cry: . The wind was knocked out of my sails as I realized how competitive the game development workforce is and that my chances were pretty slim without a CS degree. 

My journey wasn't over though. I decided to focus on learning how to develop LOB apps. I learned WPF and developed some great IT-related tools with .NET. I then decided to pick back up my web development studies. I learned ASP.NET and Entity Framework. I still found myself limited by my lack of JavaScript knowledge, so I sharpened that up as well. Now, I develop web sites as a side-gig and I suspect that I'll be doing this fulltime in the very near future. I also recognize that there are others, like me from 20 years ago, that need a gentle nudge to start their coding journey. I am committed to produce content that others can learn from and I have just recently started writing a PowerShell scripting series that you can find here on GitHub.
